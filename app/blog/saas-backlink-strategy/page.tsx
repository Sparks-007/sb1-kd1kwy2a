                <p>
                  SaaS businesses face a distinctive set of SEO hurdles:

                      Unlike broader industries, SaaS businesses often cater to specific audiences or solve unique problems. 
                      This makes it harder to find relevant backlink opportunities.

                      SaaS websites are often dynamic, focusing on features, pricing, and customer support. 
                      These factors can make traditional content marketing less straightforward.
